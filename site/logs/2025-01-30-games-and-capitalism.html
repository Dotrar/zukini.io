There’s always a few ideas going around in my head at any given time. I’m getting better at taming them and keeping them at bay while I try to get actual work done.</p>
<p>
One of my more recent ideas lately was a little mobile robotics game, something that was inspired by a kid’s toy that my toddler got for his first birthday. Basically, he got these modular car platforms that can have 2 additions on top, which are either an engine, or cabin, or bulldozer arms, or some other types of cabins and engine.</p>
<p>
I thought it would be cool to have a little buildable robot game where you could trade little modular parts like this and get different stats for your robot, then maybe do single-player missions, or even play combative with other players.</p>
<p>
It’s a nice game idea, and I’m curious (ever-curious) on how it would turn out, but i need to stay focused on my actual work. Much like how i had thoughts on running <a href="/systems/clair.html">Cl-Air</a>, I’m not in my hustle era. I don’t want to burn the candle at both ends. Yes I’d want to play around with what’s possible for human machine interaction, but unless i can write it off as completing work objectives, I don’t really want to do it at the moment.</p>
<p>
That’s not to say it’s not fun to think about, and largely it’s why I like my <a href="/systems/little-green-book.html">little green book</a> system. I can actually just doodle little modules, and work on fantasy spec sheets, and all that stuff, without being committed to the idea or having to build anything.</p>
<hr>
<p>
I have another idea to make a discord bot to help me with some chinese learning, but it’s another thing that i have to juggle. Unlike a game, this one is a little more beneficial (as it’s helping me learn chinese, and practise with bots, llms, etc). But I’ve been getting a bit too involved at work, and I’m reaching in a little too far than I’d like to.</p>
<p>
Today, specifically, was a bit of a long day, so I wanted to take the moment to write down some of my other interests and thoughts while I had a chance, because I know I do not want to pick up the computer again if I don’t have to.</p>
<p>
Thanks to my <a href="/systems/week-journal.html">weekly journal process</a> I can actually keep a log of what i’m doing throughtout the week, and find any new and interesting things that I’ve caught on to. One is to do with my pixel4a phone, and whether i want to get a fairphone like device to replace it, or try and boot it to one of the other operating systems, and maybe remove social media apps from it.</p>
<p>
Infact, yeah I think i might do that.</p>
