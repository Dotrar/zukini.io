I’m not much of a writer, I’ve struggled with maintaining a blog in the past (Zukini is probably my 5th or 6th attempt, but i’m hopeful!) and the biggest blocker for me to maintain it is to actually write.</p>

You know, the whole point: to write.</p>

Writing is an act like any other, and I’m working on systemising a habit of writing so that i can write something every day. Same as what i’m doing for chinese, and I’m doing this in a few ways.</p>
