  &lt;li&gt;
poor writing ability  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
new habits i’m trying to build  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
writing system  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m not much of a writer, I’ve struggled with maintaining a blog in the past (Zukini is probably my 5th or 6th attempt, but i’m hopeful!) and the biggest blocker for me to maintain it is to actually write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You know, the whole point: to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Writing is an act like any other, and I’m working on systemising a habit of writing so that i can write something every day. Same as what i’m doing for chinese, and I’m doing this in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
