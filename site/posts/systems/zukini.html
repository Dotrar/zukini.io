<h2> A post </h2>
&lt;p&gt;
It’s fitting that one of the first systems I put on this site is the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Zukini started out as a kanban style task management system I was building for my employer, because we were running into some task concurrency and bottlenecking issues. I took it upon myself to actually devise a system that would work better, and after I was told that it wasn’t my problem to fix, it became my ticket out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps another day I’ll write more about the philosophy that was behind it (largely kanban / JIT) but suffice to say it didn’t last. I ended up getting a new employer, and the idea to turn it into a SaaS was quickly put down. Eventually the name floated around, trying on different projects (including another blog) but nothing felt right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now we have Zukini the growth blog. But moreso than a blog, this becomes a mini system in itself to manage learning and growing, so Zukini becomes a growth system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Zukini system has a few areas of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Systems &amp;amp; Methodolgy - sharing things i’m trying to do, how i’m trying to do it, how they’re going  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Developments - Things that happened, how I’m growing in different areas and topics  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Opinions and interests - Things I find, want to share, maybe talk about.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each of these get linked across each via topics. So for a certain system, we can see opionions and intersests on the system as well as developments; and for a certain topic, we get to see systems and opinions that correlate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
Differences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thoughts and opinions get a &lt;code class=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;last_updated&lt;/code&gt; field, instead of &lt;/p&gt;
