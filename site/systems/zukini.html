<h2> A post </h2>
<p>
It’s fitting that one of the first systems I put on this site is the system itself.</p>
<p>
Zukini started out as a kanban style task management system I was building for my employer, because we were running into some task concurrency and bottlenecking issues. I took it upon myself to actually devise a system that would work better, and after I was told that it wasn’t my problem to fix, it became my ticket out of there.</p>
<p>
Perhaps another day I’ll write more about the philosophy that was behind it (largely kanban / JIT) but suffice to say it didn’t last. I ended up getting a new employer, and the idea to turn it into a SaaS was quickly put down. Eventually the name floated around, trying on different projects (including another blog) but nothing felt right.</p>
<p>
Now we have Zukini the growth blog. But moreso than a blog, this becomes a mini system in itself to manage learning and growing, so Zukini becomes a growth system.</p>
<p>
The Zukini system has a few areas of interest:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Systems &amp; Methodolgy - sharing things i’m trying to do, how i’m trying to do it, how they’re going  </li>
  <li>
Developments - Things that happened, how I’m growing in different areas and topics  </li>
  <li>
Opinions and interests - Things I find, want to share, maybe talk about.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these get linked across each via topics. So for a certain system, we can see opionions and intersests on the system as well as developments; and for a certain topic, we get to see systems and opinions that correlate.</p>
