Starting a new blogsite as a way to practise writing and generaly get better at communicating and developing ideas. This blogsite is a statically generated site that I developed while writing it, you can find more at the [Zukini](/systems/zukini) system page.

The complete sourcecode (and all posts) is available at [github](https://github.com/dotrar/zukini.io) - I hope that it is useful to you in some way.
