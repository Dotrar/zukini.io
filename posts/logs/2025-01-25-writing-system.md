- poor writing ability
- new habits i'm trying to build
- writing system

I'm not much of a writer, I've struggled with maintaining a blog in the past (Zukini is probably my 5th or 6th attempt, but i'm hopeful!) and the biggest blocker for me to maintain it is to actually write.

You know, the whole point: to write.

Writing is an act like any other, and I'm working on systemising a habit of writing so that i can write something every day. Same as what i'm doing for chinese, and I'm doing this in a few ways.
