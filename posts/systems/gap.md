GAP is a "fantasy political party" that I've been working on for a little while now; I'm only just starting to get the confidence to put it online and use it as a discussion piece in and of itself.

Largely, it could be thought of as a wishlist of policies, that if a party were available and put these as their agenda, I'd be comfortable with giving them my vote.
