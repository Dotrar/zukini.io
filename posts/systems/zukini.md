It's fitting that one of the first systems I put on this site is the system itself.

Zukini started out as a kanban style task management system I was building for my employer, because we were running into some task concurrency and bottlenecking issues. I took it upon myself to actually devise a system that would work better, and after I was told that it wasn't my problem to fix, it became my ticket out of there.

Perhaps another day I'll write more about the philosophy that was behind it (largely kanban / JIT) but suffice to say it didn't last. I ended up getting a new employer, and the idea to turn it into a SaaS was quickly put down. Eventually the name floated around, trying on different projects (including another blog) but nothing felt right.

Now we have Zukini the growth blog. But moreso than a blog, this becomes a mini system in itself to manage learning and growing, so Zukini becomes a growth system.
 
The Zukini system has a few areas of interest:

* Systems & Methodolgy - sharing things i'm trying to do, how i'm trying to do it, how they're going
* Developments - Things that happened, how I'm growing in different areas and topics
* Opinions and interests - Things I find, want to share, maybe talk about.

Each of these get linked across each via topics. So for a certain system, we can see opionions and intersests on the system as well as developments; and for a certain topic, we get to see systems and opinions that correlate.

Thoughts and opinions get a `last_updated` field, instead of
